# CovidAnalysis-India

Visualising COVID data in India with R and HTML

## Shiny App for exploratory data analysis

This RShiny Web App is written using R's web framework package i.e Shiny. 


Combining this with HTMLtemplates one can create visually pleasing applications rather than using the shinyUI itself.

## Application Deployment

The app is deployed on Rstudio's service [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and also on [R Studio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/).


The application can be seen [here](https://vko3zy-shail-jadhavrao.shinyapps.io/Shiny-App/)
